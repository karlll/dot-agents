# Changelog

All notable changes to the dot-agents multi-agent system specifications and agent definitions are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- **Initial Release**: Complete rework of repository structure to support multi-agent system
- **Specifications Framework**: Versioned profile system for shared rules and behaviors
  - `core-architecture@1.0.md`: Fundamental architectural principles and escalation rules
  - `io-protocol@1.0.yaml`: Standardized message schemas and input/output contracts
  - `formatting@1.0.md`: Consistent style rules and documentation standards
  - `safety@1.0.md`: Comprehensive safety protocols and refusal policies
  - `governance@1.0.md`: Precedence rules, conflict resolution, and update processes
- **Agent Definitions**: Three core agents with specialized capabilities
  - `planner/agent.md`: Task planning and decomposition specialist
  - `se-automation/agent.md`: Software engineering automation and code review expert
  - `data-research/agent.md`: Information gathering and knowledge synthesis specialist
- **Governance System**: Complete governance framework with precedence hierarchy
  - Safety > I/O Protocol > Core Architecture > Formatting > Agent Overrides
  - Semantic versioning for all specifications
  - Automated conflict resolution mechanisms
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and changelog for version tracking

### Technical Details
- **Profile System**: Machine-readable YAML manifests in agent definitions
- **Version Management**: Backward-compatible minor updates, breaking change management
- **Handshake Protocol**: Optional agent capability negotiation
- **Error Codes**: Standardized error reporting with governance conflict detection
- **Escalation Framework**: Security-first escalation with human oversight requirements

### Migration Notes
- **From Previous System**: Template-based system replaced with profile-based architecture
- **Breaking Changes**: Complete restructure of repository layout and file organization
- **Compatibility**: No backward compatibility with previous template system
- **Upgrade Path**: Manual migration required for any existing agent implementations

### Affected Components
- **All Agents**: planner, se-automation, data-research
- **All Specifications**: Complete new specification framework
- **Repository Structure**: New `/specs/` and `/agents/` directory organization
- **Build System**: Makefile adapted for new structure

### Dependencies
- **YAML**: Required for io-protocol schema validation
- **Markdown**: All documentation and specifications in markdown format
- **Semantic Versioning**: All components follow semver for version management

### Security Considerations
- **Safety-First Design**: Safety specifications cannot be overridden by any agent
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive privacy and sensitive data handling protocols
- **Audit Trail**: All governance decisions and safety events logged
- **Human Oversight**: Required for all security-related decisions

### Performance Impact
- **Profile Loading**: Initial overhead for profile resolution and validation
- **Governance Checks**: Runtime validation of precedence rules and conflict detection
- **Version Resolution**: Automatic compatibility checking and resolution
- **Scalability**: Designed for independent agent deployment and scaling
