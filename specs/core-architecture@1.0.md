# Core Architecture Specification v1.0

## Overview
This specification defines the fundamental architectural principles and patterns that all agents within the dot-agents system must follow.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Agents operate as independent modules with clearly defined interfaces
- Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Inter-agent communication follows standardized protocols

### 2. Consistency
- All agents follow common design patterns
- Shared behaviors are implemented through profile inheritance
- Uniform error handling and logging practices

### 3. Scalability
- Agents can be deployed independently
- Support for horizontal scaling through orchestration
- Stateless operation where possible

### 4. Reliability
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Health checks and monitoring capabilities

## Escalation Rules

### Severity Levels
1. **info**: Informational messages, normal operation
2. **warning**: Non-critical issues that may require attention
3. **error**: Operational errors that affect functionality
4. **critical**: Severe issues requiring immediate intervention
5. **security**: Security-related concerns (highest priority)

### Escalation Protocol
- Security issues escalate immediately to human operators
- Critical errors trigger automated alerts
- Warnings accumulate for batch review
- Info messages are logged for audit trails

## Agent Lifecycle

### Initialization
1. Load and validate profile configurations
2. Perform capability handshake with orchestrator
3. Register available services and endpoints
4. Enter ready state

### Operation
1. Receive and validate input according to io-protocol
2. Process requests within defined scope
3. Generate responses following output schemas
4. Log operations for audit and debugging

### Shutdown
1. Complete in-flight operations gracefully
2. Persist necessary state information
3. Deregister from orchestrator
4. Clean up resources

## Version
- Version: 1.0
- Compatibility: All agents must implement these core patterns
- Breaking changes require major version increment
