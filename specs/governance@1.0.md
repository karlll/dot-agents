# Governance Specification v1.0

## Overview
This specification defines precedence rules, conflict resolution mechanisms, and update processes for the dot-agents multi-agent system.

## Precedence Hierarchy

The following precedence order governs all agent behavior and profile resolution:

1. **Safety** (`safety@X.Y.md`) - Highest Priority
2. **I/O Protocol** (`io-protocol@X.Y.yaml`) 
3. **Core Architecture** (`core-architecture@X.Y.md`)
4. **Formatting** (`formatting@X.Y.md`)
5. **Agent Overrides** (in `agent.md` files) - Lowest Priority

### Precedence Rules
- Higher precedence specifications override lower precedence ones
- Within the same precedence level, explicit rules override defaults
- Version conflicts are resolved according to semantic versioning rules
- No agent may override safety specifications under any circumstances

## Conflict Resolution

### Conflict Types

#### Type 1: Direct Contradictions
When specifications provide contradictory instructions for the same scenario.

**Resolution Process:**
1. Apply precedence hierarchy
2. If same precedence level, flag as governance error
3. Escalate to human review
4. Document resolution in changelog

**Error Code:** `GOV:CONFLICT:DIRECT`

#### Type 2: Version Mismatches
When an agent references incompatible versions of specifications.

**Resolution Process:**
1. Check version compatibility matrix
2. Attempt automatic migration if available
3. If incompatible, require explicit agent update
4. Log compatibility warning

**Error Code:** `GOV:CONFLICT:VERSION`

#### Type 3: Capability Gaps
When required capabilities are not available or conflict.

**Resolution Process:**
1. Identify missing or conflicting capabilities
2. Check for alternative implementations
3. Graceful degradation if possible
4. Error response if critical capability missing

**Error Code:** `GOV:CONFLICT:CAPABILITY`

### Conflict Resolution Algorithm

```yaml
conflict_resolution:
  step1: "Identify conflict type and affected specifications"
  step2: "Apply precedence hierarchy to determine winner"
  step3: "Validate resolution against safety constraints"
  step4: "Generate appropriate error code if unresolvable"
  step5: "Log resolution decision and rationale"
  step6: "Update agent state with resolved configuration"
```

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
All specifications follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR`):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require agent updates
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible additions and improvements

### Version Compatibility

#### Backward Compatibility
- Minor version updates must be backward compatible
- Agents can safely use older minor versions
- New features are additive, not replacements

#### Breaking Changes
- Major version changes require explicit migration
- Migration notes must be provided in CHANGELOG.md
- Agents must be updated to support new major versions
- Grace period of 2 versions for deprecation warnings

### Version Resolution Strategy

```yaml
version_resolution:
  exact_match: "Use specified version if available"
  minor_upgrade: "Accept newer minor versions automatically"
  major_mismatch: "Require explicit agent update"
  missing_version: "Fall back to latest compatible version"
```

## Update Process

### Specification Updates

#### Minor Updates
1. **Proposal**: Submit update proposal with rationale
2. **Review**: Technical review by maintainers
3. **Testing**: Validate compatibility with existing agents
4. **Release**: Increment minor version and publish
5. **Notification**: Inform agent maintainers of new version

#### Major Updates
1. **RFC Process**: Formal request for comments period
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess breaking changes and migration effort
3. **Migration Guide**: Create detailed migration documentation
4. **Staged Rollout**: Phased deployment with monitoring
5. **Support**: Provide migration assistance and troubleshooting

### Agent Updates

#### Profile Version Updates
Agents should regularly update to latest compatible versions:
- Monitor specification updates through changelog
- Test compatibility with new versions
- Update manifest references in agent.md
- Validate behavior with updated profiles

#### Override Management
When adding or modifying overrides:
- Document rationale for override
- Ensure compliance with governance rules
- Test override behavior thoroughly
- Monitor for conflicts with future updates

## Compliance Enforcement

### Automated Validation
- Profile reference validation in agent manifests
- Version compatibility checking
- Override rule compliance verification
- Governance rule conflict detection

### Manual Review Requirements
- All major version updates
- New agent registrations
- Safety specification changes
- Governance rule modifications

### Enforcement Actions

#### Warning Level
- Version compatibility advisories
- Minor override conflicts
- Deprecated feature usage
- Performance guideline violations

#### Error Level
- Direct rule conflicts
- Invalid version references
- Safety compliance failures
- Critical capability mismatches

#### Critical Level
- Safety override attempts
- Unauthorized system access
- Data protection violations
- Security policy breaches

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Trail Requirements
All governance decisions must be logged with:
- Decision timestamp and context
- Affected specifications and versions
- Resolution methodology applied
- Rationale for decision
- Impact on system behavior

### Compliance Reporting
- Monthly governance health reports
- Quarterly version compatibility audits
- Annual security and safety reviews
- Incident-based compliance assessments

### Metrics and Monitoring
- Conflict resolution frequency and types
- Version adoption rates across agents
- Override usage patterns and trends
- Governance rule effectiveness measures

## Emergency Procedures

### Urgent Security Updates
1. **Immediate Release**: Bypass normal review for critical security fixes
2. **Mandatory Adoption**: Require all agents to update within 24 hours
3. **Temporary Overrides**: Allow emergency overrides of normal governance
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Analyze incident and improve procedures

### Governance System Failures
1. **Fallback Mode**: Revert to last known good configuration
2. **Manual Override**: Enable human administrator intervention
3. **System Recovery**: Restore governance system functionality
4. **Validation**: Verify system integrity before resuming automation
